## Observations at Higher Duty Cycles

- The output voltage (Vo) increased steadily with the duty cycle (D) until approximately **86%**, after which it began to decrease.  
- This drop in output voltage occurs due to **inductor saturation**. When the duty cycle increases to a point where the critical inductance value exceeds the actual inductor value, the inductor reaches its energy storage limit, it cannot store additional energy, leading to unstable operation.  
- Additionally, the **capacitor discharges its stored charge**, releasing it into the circuit, further contributing to the drop in output voltage.  
- Using a higher value of inductor can help mitigate this issue by preventing saturation and ensuring stable operation.

## Key Insights

1. The output voltage depends heavily on the duty cycle, but practical limitations like inductor saturation and capacitor discharge can affect performance.  
2. The calculated duty cycles in the table provide an approximate representation of the PWM signals generated by the 555 timer circuit.  
3. Accurate measurement of the duty cycle is necessary for fine-tuning the converter, which requires equipment like an oscilloscope or PWM analyzer.  
4. The type and specifications of components (inductor core, capacitor rating, MOSFET characteristics) significantly influence the performance and efficiency of the boost converter.
5. There are heating losses in the MOSFET and inductor during prolonged use, and no heat sinks have been incorporated to manage these losses, which may affect the efficiency and longevity of the components.
