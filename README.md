# Boost Converter Project

This repository contains the design and simulation details for the **Boost Converter**.

## Brief Description of the Boost Converter
A **Boost Converter** is a type of DC-DC power converter that steps up the input voltage to a higher output voltage. It uses an inductor, a switch, and a diode to store and release energy. The converter works by storing energy in the inductor during the "on" phase of the switch and then releasing it to the load during the "off" phase. This process allows the converter to increase the input voltage and provide a stable output voltage.

The Boost Converter is widely used in applications such as renewable energy systems, portable electronics, and automotive systems where stepping up a lower DC voltage to a higher DC voltage is required. Its high efficiency, relatively simple design, and ability to boost voltages make it an essential component in power supply designs.

### Key Features:
- **Voltage Step-Up:** Increases a lower input DC voltage to a higher output DC voltage.
- **Compact Design:** Suitable for a wide range of applications where space and efficiency are important.
- **Versatile Applications:** Used in solar systems, battery-powered devices, and other power supply circuits where the input voltage is lower than the required output voltage.
